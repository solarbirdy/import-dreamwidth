# import-dreamwidth
This is a tool for importing Dreamwidth journal XML backups into WordPress.

I did a lot of searching trying to figure out how to get my Dreamwidth blog entries and their comments brought over into my new WordPress install, and from what I could find, nobody's managed it.

Until now.

It's not a good importer; I wrote it well enough to be used successfully by me, once. Then it turned out more people wanted to do this and asked me to share my code. So I made it _very slightly_ less terrible, fixed a few bugs, ripped out a bunch of unnecessary code, de-hardcoded some paths, and here we go. Basically I did just enough that it has a shot of working for you if you know what you're doing and have your own standalone Wordpress install.

In short, don't worry: it's still terrible. No warranty express or etc. Run it on a test blog installation first to make sure it doesn't explode. Then run it on your real blog once you know it's safe.


FEATURES:

Brings in posts, _and_ comments, _and_ maintains comment threads, _and_ commenter names IF AND ONLY IF the comments actually originated on Dreamwidth. (Livejournal-originated comment poster names are not preserved; I can't get to them either.)

Preserves Current Music (but _not_ Current Mood).

Preserves Dreamwidth tags, adding them as Wordpress tags. Posts without tags are tagged "no-tag."

Imported posts can be automatically categorised either as "imported post" or "Uncategorised."

Post formatting is preserved.

Link to original post is preserved in new-post metadata


ISSUES:

oh god so many

The Dreamwidth user tag is not well preserved. Neither is the Livejournal user tag, so LJ names may disappear from text.

Current Mood is not preserved.

You have to marshal a lot more resources depending upon how big your exported journal is. See below for details.

Various friends groups are all condensed into a single "password protected" mode, due to reasons.

It's not what you'd call real fast.


STUFF YOU NEED TO DO AND RESOURCES YOU NEED TO ALLOCATE:

FIRST -- create an XML backup of your Dreamwidth journal using this tool from the official dreamwidth github:

https://github.com/dreamwidth/dreamwidth/blob/main/src/jbackup/jbackup.pl

Where it says "Password," it actually wants an API key, which you can generate through Dreamwidth's web interface. If you're using JournalPress with Dreamwidth to echo posts from a WordPress blog to your journal, you can use that one.

SECOND -- set a whole bunch of resource allocations:

In [wp-home]/wp-includes/functions.php set runtime to 300 seconds max (default is 30 â€“ and yes this is core code, deal with it) by adding this up top:

ini_set('max_execution_time', '300');

In /etc/php/[your version]/apache2/php.ini set runtime maximum to 90 seconds (default is 30):

max_execution_time = 90

and set process memory allocation limit to 1GB (default is like 132MB):

memory_limit = 1G

Using mysql console for MariaDB, increase maximum allowed packet size (default is 1:6777216)

SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=1073741824;

THIRD -- Install the import tool. The default Wordpress install provides a Livejournal importer, accessible from the Tools/Import menu. It lives in wp-content/plugins/livejournal-importer and is named livejournal-importer.php. Make a backup copy of the livejournal-importer.php file, and then replace the original with the livejournal.importer.php from this project. Make sure to keep the same permissions on the file!

FOURTH -- Take the XML backup you made in Step 1 and place it into the same livejournal-importer directory. Name it "importme.xml" and give it the same permissions as the other files already in the directory.


YOU'RE READY TO RUN!

Congratulations(?), you're finally ready to run. Go to Tools/Import, select Livejournal. It'll bring up a Dreamwidth importer instead! Read the directions, provide a password for protected posts if you want to, and hit go.

And then hopefully, you'll be done!
